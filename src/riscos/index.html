    <h1>Assorted RISC OS Software</h1>

    <p>
Everything here, unless explicitly mentioned, should run on all versions of
RISC OS from 3.10 onwards, and be 26/32 bit compatible. Some of the things
here require other bits of software, there is a collection of links to these
on the <a href="resources.html">resources page</a>.

    <h2>Avalanche VNC Client</h2>
    <p>
A VNC client allowing remote control of computers over a local network or
the internet. You need to be running a VNC server on the remote machine.
    </p>
    <p><img src="img/avalanche.jpg" align="right">Features include:
     <ul>
       <li>Raw, CopyRect, RRE, CoRRE, Hextile and ZLib encodings.</li>
       <li>Unauthenticated sessions and VNC authentication.</li>
       <li>6, 15 and 24bpp true colour and 8bpp colour mapped screens.</li>
       <li>Screen resizing (DeaktopSize pseudo-encoding).</li>
       <li>Local pointer display (Cursor and XCursor pseudo-encodings).</li>
       <li>Hotlist/choices (needs <a href="resources.html">ConfiX</a>).</li>
       <li>UTF-8/forign alphabet support (RISC OS 5).</li>
       <li>Multiple scaled views, screen export, screen auto-scroll.</li>
       <li>Clipboard support.</li>
       <li>Full screen mode</li>
       <li>ARMv7 compatible.</li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
Optionally requires <a href="resources.html">ConfiX</a> (for hotlist/choices), BypassAlt (fixes Alt and Command key problems so that things like Alt-Enter or Alt-C (Command-C for mac users) work as expected - see below to download) and <a href="resources.html">SysLog</a>. <a href="https://github.com/effarig/ro_avalanche/releases">Download Avalanche</a>.
    </p>
    <br><hr>
    <h2>BypassAlt</h2>
    <p>
A utility module which allows applications to disable the usual behaviour of
the Alt keys. So, when enabled, Alt-C will generate a wimp key event for 'C'
rather than '&#xa9;'. The Alt keys can still be interrogated using
INKEY. Requires RISC OS 3.5+ <a href="https://github.com/effarig/ro-bypassalt/releases">Download BypassAlt</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>EtherUSB</h2>
    <p>
      A DeviceFS (i.e. RISC OS 5) USB driver for Ethernet devices.
    </p>
    <p>
The driver supports concurrent use of numerous different types of USB Ethernet device. To support configuring hot-plugged devices reliably the DCI interface name (ej0, ej1, etc.) can be configured by MAC, Vendor/Product or USB bus location, using system variables.
    </p>
    <p>
 As of version 0.14, EtherUSB is now part of <a href="https://www.riscosopen.org/">RISC OS Open</a> and is maintained in <a href="https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/Networking/Ethernet/EtherUSB">their GitLab repository<a>.
    </p>
    <br><hr>
    <h2>SysLogDevice</h2>
    <p>
A write only DeviceFS driver directing all output to SysLog. Lets SysLog be
used with standard file access calls, for example using fprintf() from C,
BPUT from BASIC or any command line utility by using stream redirection.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example: <tt>*Modules { &gt; Devices#Log=Test:$.SysLog }</tt>
    </p>
    <p>
This is particularly useful for redirecting the error streams of
applications as SysLogDevice allows an arbitrary number of open streams to
any log.
    </p>
    <p>
Requires <a href="resources.html">SysLog</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/effarig/ro-syslog-device/releases">Download SysLogDevice</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>KeyMapper</h2>
    <p>
A small module which can redefine the key codes returned by keyboard or mouse
drivers before they reach the kernel, allowing keys and mouse buttons to be
swapped around.
Requires RISC OS 3.5+

    </p>

    <h2>Which</h2>
    <p>
Command line utility to find where a *command is in the system. It checks system variable aliases, modules and object on the run path reporting which one will be executed. <a href="download/which.zip">Download Which</a>.
    </p>

    <br><hr>
    <h2>WatchLog</h2>
    <p>
Command line utility to output text written at the end of a file, similarly to <tt>tail -f</tt> in *NIX. Works nicely in TaskWindows with SysLogs. <a href="download/watchlog.zip">Download WatchLog</a>.
    </p>

    <br><hr>
    <h2>LSOF</h2>
    <p>
Command line utility listing open files, not much else to say really. <a href="download/lsof.zip">Download LsOF</a>.
